# OCP Core Chess

3rd attempt at making a chess playing engine.

## Developer Notes

### TODOs

- Do not castle through check.
- Hybrid copy/do/undo - only make a copy if recursing, just undo otherwise?
- Almost certainly safer to use 2 bits for colour.
- Promotions.
- Get movement working before adding pooling to `_cells` in `Board`.
- Move ordering?
  - Captures preferred. 
  - Lower valur taking higher even better.
  - Moves that don't go onto an attacked square.
